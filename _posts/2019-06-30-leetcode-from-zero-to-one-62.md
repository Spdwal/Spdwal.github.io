# 62 - Unique Paths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

经典的dp题目，但是我还是不会做。

最初是直接使用`dp[m][n]`来做，但是空间复杂度太高了。

经过优化使用一个`cur[]`即可。

 ```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<int> cur(n, 1);
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                cur[j] += cur[j - 1];
            }
        }
        return cur[n - 1];
    }
};
 ```
